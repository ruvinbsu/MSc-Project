# MSc-Project
During this project, I designed and implemented a prototype of an Information Retrieval System (IRS), in a domain of Technical Documents (TDs). This system is used to investigate whether and how an ontology-based IRS can help to retrieve TDs that are relevant for the user. As an example for this project, I use TDs that were obtained from Ericsson and represent them in an OWL ontology.
This work investigates and presents design choices, which are applied to different building blocks of the IRS. The ontology is modelled in a multi-dimensional way and this kind of modelling is exposed to the user via a multi-faceted browser.
